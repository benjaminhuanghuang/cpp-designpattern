##  C++ Design Pattern
Flexibale, maintinable ane extensible

- Creational patterns are focused on instantiating objects in a way that hides the mechanisms of their creation from the rest of the program. Make decison at run time.
 
- Structural patterns simplify the **relationships and hierarchies** between different classes and how they can be used to build larger and more complex entities. 
 
- Behavioral patterns provide common ways objects can **communicate** with one another
